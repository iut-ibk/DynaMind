 * @brief DynaMind Log
 *
 * The Logger is implemented as singleton. The Logger need to initialsed by calling the init function.
 * With the init function a LogSink is registered and the max LogLevel is defined.
 * Following LogLevels can be used:
 * - Debug
 * - Standard
 * - Warning
 * - Error
 * Error is the highest and Debug the lowest LogLevel. Only messages with the current LogLevel or higher are send to the sink.
 * After Log is initalised messages the logger can be used like DM::Logger(DM::Standard) << "Test"
 *
 * Sample code to redirect logging to cout
 * @code
 * //redirect out to cout
 * ostream *out = &cout;
 * //Create a new LogSink (cout) and use the Standard LogLevel
 * DM::Log::init(new DM::OStreamLogSink(*out), DM::Standard);
 * DM::Logger(DM::Standard) << "Hello Logger";
 * @endcode
